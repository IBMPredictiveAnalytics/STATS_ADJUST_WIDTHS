<pre class="example"><code>STATS ADJUST WIDTHS 
VARIABLES = string1 string2 DSNAMEROOT=ds_ WIDTH=MAX
/FILES=ds1 &quot;c:/data/mydata.sav&quot;
/OUTFILE RESAVE=YES SUFFIX=&quot;_adj&quot; OVERWRITE=YES
CLOSE=NO.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>VARIABLES</strong> lists one or more string variables whose widths will be made the
same for each variable across the files.  Each variable must exist in at least
one of the files.  If there is a numeric/string type mismatch, it is reported.
VARIABLES=ALL can be used to select all string variables.</p>

<p><strong>WIDTH</strong> specifies how the widths should be adjusted.  Each variable&#39;s width is made
the same across the files in which it exists.  For MAX, the width will be the
largest found.  For MIN, it will be the smallest.  For FIRST, it will be the
width found in the first file.  In that case, the variables must all exist in
the first file.  Reducing the widths can, of course, result in loss of data.</p>

<p><strong>MAXWIDTH</strong> can be specified to limit the calculated width.</p>

<p><strong>EXACTWIDTH</strong> can be specified to set all the variables to the same width.
If used, WIDTH is ignored, and MAXWIDTH cannot be specified.</p>

<p>If there is only one file/dataset to process, only MAXWIDTH or EXACTSIZE
can cause any string widths to change.</p>

<p>Files that are opened must be assigned a dataset name by this procedure.</p>

<p><strong>DSNAMEROOT</strong>, which defaults to <em>adjust_</em> is used as the prefix for each name, 
and the remainder of the name is a sequential number.  Inputs specified as 
dataset names are not affected.  If the generated dataset name is already 
in use, it is reassigned to this list, and the previous owner of the dataset 
name will, therefore, be closed.</p>

<h2>FILES</h2>

<p>The FILES subcommand lists the datasets or file specifications to modify.
The list can contain file names, file name wildcards such as <code>&quot;c:/data/x*.sav&quot;</code>,
and dataset names that are assigned to data.  However, <code>*</code> is interpreted
as a reference to the active dataset, not as a wildcard.</p>

<p>If a file that is listed in a file specification is already open, it will be reopened, and
given a new dataset name, and any previous unsaved changes will be lost.
Datasets, of course, are not reopened.  A dataset name that is only declared,
of course, will not work.</p>

<h2>OUTFILE</h2>

<p>By default, all the files are left open.  The OUTFILE subcommand allows for
different behavior.
<strong>RESAVE</strong> specifies whether a file that was opened is resaved to disk.
Datasets in the input list are only saved if <strong>DIRECTORY</strong> is used.  In
that case, the dataset name with an <em>sav</em> extension becomes the file name.</p>

<p><strong>SUFFIX</strong> optionally specifies a suffix to be added to the file name root for the
saved file.  For example, a file opened as data.sav would be saved as
<code>data_adjusted</code> if <code>SUFFIX=&quot;_adjusted&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>By default, files are saved to the input directory.  <strong>DIRECTORY</strong> specifies
an alternative location for the saved files.  The directory will be created
if it does not exist, but the path up to the last portion must already exist.</p>

<p><strong>OVERWRITE</strong> specifies whether the save tries to overwrite an existing file.
By default, files are not overwritten.</p>

<p><strong>CLOSE</strong> specifies whether to close any file that was opened.  Using RESAVE=NO
with CLOSE=YES is not very useful.  The active dataset, if included, is not closed.
Note: If the number of files to process is large, it may be necessary to 
specify CLOSE=YES in order to avoid having an excessive number of files
open with possible resource exhaustion.</p>

<p>After the width adjustments, the
active dataset will be the last file that was processed.  Only files or datasets
that are modified are resaved.</p>

<p>The active file must have a dataset name in order to run this command.</p>
